# fray-documentation-research
This documentation is for researching every file of [Pyxus's Fray combat framework](https://github.com/Pyxus/fray) made for Godot 4.X

Currently, this is a WIP, so not all files are not researched yet.

The reason i made this is for helping Pyxus document Fray.

[The examples that I made are located on this repository.](https://github.com/Lukaswbrr/fray-documentation-research-examples)
