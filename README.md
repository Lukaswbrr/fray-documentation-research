# fray-documentation-research
This documentation is for researching every file of Pyxus's Fray combat framework made for Godot 4.X

Currently, this is a WIP, so not all files are not researched yet.

Later, there will be examples using Fray in this documentation. (or maybe in another repository idk)

The reason i made this is for helping Pyxus document Fray.
