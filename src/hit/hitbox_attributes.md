## Functionality
Used for hit attributes, example color and detection system.

Meant as a abstract base for making new hit attributes.

This is meant to be used as a resource, meaning you need to create .tres resources for new
hitbox attributes with different scripts!

## Used for
hitbox_2d (Also used to change debug colors in the hitbox script)
- First, you add the hitbox attribute to the hitbox and, after you create a collision shape, it will
automatically be in that color. doesn't apply to already created shapes!
